  <Text>k__BackingField: What?! You work in a tavern; cleanliness and care should
    be standard practice for you, curse it!
  <Choices>k__BackingField:
  - <Text>k__BackingField: You're right, I'll be more careful next time. Perhaps
      you'll give me some advice when there are fewer customers. I'll prepare your
      mead.

      you who cares too much to be... a dwarf!
